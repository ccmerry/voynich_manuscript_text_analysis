# voynich_manuscript_text_analysis
Executive Summary

In 1912, a document was rediscovered called the Voynich Manuscript. It contains
roughly 240 pages of an unknown language. It has fascinated me for some time. I want
to classify the words used in the Voynich Manuscript. Use images of the pages and apply
a machine learning technique to find the number of characters in the text. Since there is
not a known cipher for the text, I will need to find a method of confirming the results.

Motivation
I enjoy cryptology, history, and machine learning. The Voynich Manuscript
encompasses all three of these fields. It is also a document that has stumped many code
breakers and mathematicians. I think it would be interesting to analyze the validity of
the text as a language or random markings

Data Question
What does a classification of the characters and words used in the Voynich manuscript
look like? Is topic detection possible based off word frequency and their location?

Minimum Viable Product
Determine the frequency of words and if they follow zipfâ€™s law.
Additional:
Topic Model the Voynich Manuscript using LDA to detetct if topics can be derived and compare against a random sampling
